## Research Interest

My main fields of interest are macroeconomics & labor economics, time series econometrics, computational economics and machine learning.

## Projects 

1. #### [Talk â€“ GPU-Accelerated Value Function Iteration in Julia](https://youtu.be/ehUb-S6Bxnk?t=13m42s)
    JuliaCon 2018 - *August 2018*
    <br><br>
    At JuliaCon 2018 I presented my project on using Julia and GPUArrays.jl to solve macroeconomic models faster when using Value Function Iteration.
2. #### [GPU/OpenCL Value Function Iteration in Julia](https://github.com/giob1994/GPU-OpenCL-VFI-in-Julia)
    Final Project, Computation Economics - *2018*
    <br><br>
    A simple implementation in Julia of a Value Function Interation algorithm that runs on the GPU thanks to OpenCL.
